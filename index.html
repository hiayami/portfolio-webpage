                <p>Welcome! </p>
                <br>
                <p>My name is Ayami and I am a full time, registered operating room nurse. My role as a circulating nurse specializes mostly in the service line that includes
                    orthopedic and spine surgeries.</p>
                 <p>I am currently attending a Coding Bootcamp Program through the University of Washington that covers lessons and languages for full stack web development. This 
                    webpage will host personal work and projects that display my current skillset.</p>
                <p>My passion resides in nursing and I want to discover other avenues that the career field has to offer. I am learning skills that have potential to be useful 
                    in Clinical Informatics and Patient-Centered Technologies. While this is just one example of an area in nursing that can use skills taught from this course, 
                    this coding Bootcamp opens doors to many other possibilities that I look forward to exploring.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
