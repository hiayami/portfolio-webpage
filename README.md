# Intro:

    For this assignment, a webpage was created with HTML and CSS to showcase skills and previous projects. This portfolio has been updated and will continue to be updated as skills are and knowledge are acquired over time.

    The goals of this project is to design a portfolio page that is responsive, has working internal links in the navigation, and images or buttons will deploy to the respective applications when clicked on. 

    One of the purposes of creating a portfolio page is to add credibility towards our knowledge and skills in the professional and academic fields. 

## User Story:

    I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
    SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria:

    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


### Process:

    An HTML layout was created, followed by a CSS stylesheet to add details. Classes were created to apply certain styles to specific elements. 

    This webpage uses different CSS properties such as display, flex-wrap, and box styling.
    
    Links for GitHub profile and Linkedin profile are added to the page, as well as an updated resume.
