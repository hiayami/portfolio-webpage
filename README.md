# Intro:
    For this assignment, a webpage was created with HTML and CSS to showcase skills and previous projects.

    The goals of this project is to design a portfolio page that is responsive, has working internal links in the navigation, and images or buttons will deploy to the respective applications when clicked on. 

    One of the purposes of creating a portfolio page is to add credibility towards our knowledge and skills in the professional and academic fields. 

## Process:
    An HTML layout was created, followed by a CSS stylesheet to add details. Classes were created to apply certain styles to specific elements. For example, I wanted different styles and ideas implemented on the buttons that are layed out on the page. To do this, I needed different class names (button1 and button2) to apply these different, specific styles. 

    This webpage uses different CSS properties such as display, flex-wrap, and box styling.
    
    Comments are placed on the CSS style page under areas that were new to me and reasons why those styles were needed to accomplish certain effects.
